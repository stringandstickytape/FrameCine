# The environments engine

An environment is **data over trusted systems**. A room is a version 4 room document. The document names systems
from a **registry** and gives them parameters. The systems are GDScript in the app, reviewed like the rest of the
code. A document never holds code: no expressions, no scripts, no shaders. Everything a document can say is checked
against the registry before anything is built.

This file is the design. The agents that build the systems and the rooms are briefed from it. D30 in
`docs/decisions.md` is the decision.

## The pieces

```
 room document (JSON, version 4)
   room, screen, acoustics, audio          the room as a whole
   systems: [{system, id, params}]         ---> registry (scripts/env/systems/registry.gd) ---> system scripts
   settings: [{name, type, ...}]           ---> room settings (scripts/env/room_settings.gd) ---> the Room tab
   cues, timeline                          ---> timeline (scripts/env/env_timeline.gd)
   parts, seats, sky, ...                  the version 3 keys, as before (objects, materials, pictures)

 env_room.gd (the environment node)  builds  env_host.gd ("Systems": the systems, the signals, the timeline)
 film signals (scripts/env/env_signals.gd)   film.colour, film.bass, ...  --->  bindings on system parameters
 audio buses (scripts/env/env_audio.gd)      Film, Environment (ducked under Film), Interface
 checks (scripts/env/env_checks.gd)          schema, headset budget, sight line, comfort, licences, names, no people
```

- `app/environments/<id>.env.json` is a room that ships. `app/environments/<id>.tscn` holds only the node: its
  script is `env_room.gd` (or a thin script that extends it, as `cinema.gd`) and its `document` path.
- An assistant can send a version 4 document too (`docs/assistant.md`, "Rooms from systems"). It is built on its
  base room like any assistant's room, with the systems added.

## Where each part is

This file is the foundation: the document, the registry, bindings, the timeline and room settings. Each system and
each room has a file of its own (since 2026-11-09; before, all of it was this one file of 350 KB, more than a tool
reads in one go). A text that says "below" or "above" of a section that is not in its own file means the file here.

| Part | File |
|---|---|
| The checks, what the rooms measure, the pictures a room draws | `docs/environments/checks.md` |
| The builders: `auditorium`, `shopfront`, `nave`, `dome_hall`, `terrace`, `domestic`, `vehicle`; a room's screen | `docs/environments/builders.md` |
| The `cabin` builder (a vehicle's inside, for the journeys) | `docs/environments/cabin.md` |
| The kit | `docs/environments/kit.md` |
| The seats system | `docs/environments/seats.md` |
| The motion system | `docs/environments/motion.md` |
| The passing system (scenery that goes by; a journey as long as the film) | `docs/environments/passing.md` |
| Atmosphere and weather | `docs/environments/atmosphere.md` |
| The audio buses, sound beds, acoustics, music | `docs/environments/sound.md` |
| Ambient life | `docs/environments/life.md` |
| The sky and the vista | `docs/environments/sky.md` |
| The presentation system | `docs/environments/presentation.md` |
| The rooms: the cinema set, the television rooms and time travel, the journeys | `docs/environments/rooms/README.md` |
| One room | `docs/environments/rooms/<id>.md` (the id is its document's: `app/environments/<id>.env.json`) |

An agent that works on one system or one room reads this file and that one.

## The version 4 document

Version 4 is version 3 (`docs/assistant.md`, "The room document") with sections for the systems. Versions 1 to 3 are
still read, without change. Every key of version 3 keeps its meaning.

```json
{"schema": 4,
 "name": "Cinema",
 "room": {"ambient": 0.05, "screen_glow": 1.0, "curtains": true},
 "screen": {"center": [0, 1.6, -13.8], "size": [12.0, 5.0]},
 "acoustics": {"reflect": [0.35, 0.35, 0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3], "rt60": 0.8, "wet": 0.5, "late": 1.8},
 "systems": [
   {"system": "light", "params": {"house_lamps": 1.0}},
   {"system": "auditorium", "id": "hall", "params": {"rows_front": 7, "rows_back": 3}},
   {"system": "screen_frame"},
   {"system": "showing"}],
 "settings": [
   {"name": "house_level", "type": "range", "min": 0.0, "max": 0.6, "step": 0.05, "default": 0.12,
    "format": "percent", "label": "House lights in the film",
    "description": "How bright the house lights stay while the film plays."}],
 "cues": [{"name": "ritual", "when": {"state": "starting"}, "requires": [{"setting": "ritual"}],
           "steps": [{"do": "showing.open_curtains", "args": {"seconds": 5}},
                     {"set": "light.house_lamps", "to": 0.0, "seconds": 6}]}],
 "timeline": {"starting_seconds": 8, "credits_minutes": 6},
 "audio": {"level_db": 0.0, "pause_rise_db": 3.0}}
```

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| `schema` | 4 |
| `name` | the room's name; a room that ships has its name as a translation key |
| `room` | the room as a whole: `ambient` (0..1, its surfaces' light with a dark screen), `screen_glow` (0..2), `curtains` (the pre-show's curtains may close here), `reacts_to_film` (the film's transients may flash the light), `reflection` (the floor reflection's default here), `reflection_floor` (its height; null: none), `curtain_colour` (the pre-show's curtains' colour; null, the
default: the app's red velvet; since 2026-11-08, the Palace of Culture's ochre) and `category` (where the Room tab lists it: `cinema` under Cinemas, `tv` under Television, `journey` under Journeys, `other` with the other rooms, the default; one table, `env_doc.gd ROOM_GROUPS`, which the Room tab and `env_library.gd category_of()` both read: a new category is a line there) and `description` (a line about the room under the Room tab's "This room", at most 200 characters; a key, so a room that ships translates it) |
| `screen` | as version 3: the default screen's `center` and `size` |
| `acoustics` | the room's sound for spatial audio (`get_sound_room()`, `scripts/play/spatial_audio.gd`): `box` ({min, max}; default: the builder's walls), `reflect`, `rt60`, `wet`, `late` (the late reverb against the reflections, 0..2, default 0.5), `surround_height`, `array`, `array_spacing`, `ring`, `distance`; below, "The film's room" |
| `systems` | the systems, in build order: `{system, id, params}`. `id` defaults to the system's name; two of one system need their own ids. Cues and bindings address a parameter as `<id>.<param>` |
| `settings` | the room's own settings (below, "Room settings") |
| `cues` | sequences the timeline runs (below, "Timeline and cues") |
| `timeline` | `starting_seconds`, `credits_minutes`, `tracks` (film-time tracks) |
| `audio` | `level_db` (the room's sounds against the Environment bus, -24..6), `pause_rise_db` (0..6: how much the ambience rises while paused or in the pre-show) |
| `credits` | every bundled asset the room uses that is not a library material or object: `{asset, title, source, licence}` (licence CC0 only) |
| `parts`, `seats`, `sky`, `light`, `lights`, `atmosphere`, `recolour`, `default_seat` | version 3, unchanged |

Validation: `room_schema.gd validate()` reads a version 4 document as version 3 and hands the new sections to
`scripts/env/env_doc.gd`. Every problem comes back with its JSON path, as before:
`{"path": "$.systems[1].params.rows_front", "error": "at most 30"}`.

## Systems and the registry

`scripts/env/systems/registry.gd` maps a name to a script. A system is a `Node` that extends
`scripts/env/systems/env_system.gd`.

### What a system declares

```gdscript
static func spec() -> Dictionary:
	return {
		"name": "auditorium",
		"kind": "builder",          # builder, kit, light, sky, atmosphere, life, sound, music, screen, seats,
		                            # motion, showing (the table below)
		"description": "Stadium rows on a rake, ...",
		"params": {
			"rows_front": {"type": "int", "min": 0, "max": 30, "default": 7,
					"description": "rows in front of the viewer's own"},
			"house_lamps": {"type": "float", "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0, "default": 1.0, "live": true,
					"brightness": true, "description": "the house lights' glow"},
		},
		"actions": {"open_curtains": "the curtains part (args: seconds)"},
		"cost": {"draws": 18, "triangles": 120000, "lights": 0, "particles": 0, "texture_mb": 40},
		"provides": ["seats", "collision", "bake", "sound_room"],
		"requires": ["light"],
	}
```

- **Parameter types:** `float`, `int` (with `min` and `max`), `bool`, `color` (`"#rrggbb"` or `[r, g, b]`),
  `enum` (`values`), `vec2`, `vec3`, `string` (`max`), `list` (`of`: an element's spec, `max`), `material` (a
  library material: `{library, color, tiling, ...}`), `object` (`fields`: a spec per field).
- **`live`:** the parameter can change while the room shows. Only a live parameter can follow a film signal or be
  moved by a cue. A setting bound to a parameter that is not live makes the system build again (geometry).
- **`brightness`:** the parameter changes how bright something is. The comfort check keeps every change to it under
  the photosensitivity ceiling (`room_schema.gd MAX_HZ`).
- **`motion`:** `{"max": x}` on a parameter that moves something the viewer sees (a sway, a tilt, gate weave): the
  comfort check holds it to that limit, and the room's Motion setting scales it. `"when": "<param>"` names the
  parameter that switches the motion on: a room offers the Motion setting for it only where that parameter is on
  (the house light's `caustic_speed` with `caustics` above 0, so the cinema shows no Motion setting).
- **`cost`:** an estimate, for the assistant. The budget check measures the built room.
- **The assistant's schema and the docs come from the registry:** the `room_systems` command lists every spec.

### What a system does

```gdscript
var host      # env_host.gd: signals, timeline, the room's settings, other systems (host.system(id))
var room      # the environment node it builds into (env_room.gd, or an assistant's room)
var id        # its id in the document
var params    # its parameters, defaults filled in, bindings at their current values

func setup() -> void                      # build: add nodes to the room with own(node)
func set_param(name, value) -> void       # a live parameter changed (a binding, a cue, a setting)
func act(action, args) -> void            # a cue's "do"
func tick(delta) -> void                  # every frame the room shows
func on_state(state, previous) -> void    # the timeline's state changed
func on_seek(from, to) -> void            # the film's position jumped (seconds)
func on_screen_changed(local: Transform3D, size: Vector2) -> void
# Optional hooks, each used when the system provides it:
func seats() -> Array[Transform3D]        # floor points under the seated eyes, facing -Z
func collision_shapes() -> Array          # [[Shape3D, Transform3D]] for object physics
func sound_room() -> Dictionary           # walls for spatial audio
func static_meshes(), bake_lights(), set_baking(on), set_baked(on)   # the lightmap bake (light systems)
```

A system never reads a file a document names, never loads a script and never evaluates text. It reads its own
parameters only.

`own(node)` keeps node names steady when a room has two systems of one kind (two kits, two builders): a name the room
already has takes the system's id after it (the second kit's `PieceStatic` is `PieceStatic_furniture`), never the
engine's `@...@` name, and the node keeps its plain name in the meta `env_name`. A motion system's `node` finds a
system's node by either name. Tested in `test_env_kit.gd` (two kits in one room).

### The systems

| System | Kind | Role | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| `light` | light | the house materials (the library on the house shader: fill, the film's spill, stand-in lamps before a bake), the lamp glows by group (house, steps, stage, signs), the hidden bake lights, the bake hooks. The screen is the main light: every lit surface takes the film's spill. `caustics` (live, a brightness; since 2026-11-08): the light of a water's surface above, a slowly drifting web on whatever faces up, not dimmed by the house lights; `caustic_colour`, `caustic_scale` (metres a cell), `caustic_speed` (`motion`). Two more texture reads on the house shader where it is on (`procedural.gd caustic_map()`, 256 x 256, 64 KB) | built |
| `auditorium` | builder | stadium rows on a rake, seats, aisles, side walls and panels, proscenium and screen wall, ceiling, step and house lights, curved rows, balcony, boxes, open ceiling, a partition wall | built |
| `screen_frame` | screen | the black masking round the screen, the projector's beam from a lens (`beam_style` `flat`, or `volume`: light summed through the beam's pyramid, `beam_strength`; since 2026-11-08) | built |
| `showing` | showing | the curtains' part in the ritual: actions `open_curtains`, `close_curtains` (the pre-show's curtains, `scripts/env/preshow.gd`) | built |
| `mirror_floor` | builder | a black floor that takes the film's reflection, a ripple where the viewer moves | built |
| `shopfront`, `nave`, `dome_hall`, `terrace`, `domestic`, `vehicle` | builder | the other parametric structures (shopfront hall, nave, dome, open-air terrace or lot, domestic room, vehicle interior; below, "The builders") | built |
| `kit` | kit | modular pieces placed along a builder's slots (balcony fronts, niches, columns, façades; below, "The kit") | built |
| objects, materials, pictures | | as now: `parts` placements, library materials, pictures (an assistant's room). A shipped room's things are kit pieces (below, "The kit"): the kit builds them on the house shader, lit as the room is, and its pieces are original, so a document room places no library objects | as now |
| `sky`, `vista` | sky | a sky dome (twilight to night, the real stars and constellations, the Milky Way, clouds lit by the screen, an aurora, Earth from the Moon), far scenery from simple shapes (hills, mesas, a floodlit acropolis, birches in snow, cypresses, a glowing pool); below, "The sky and the vista" | built |
| `atmosphere`, `weather` | atmosphere | haze, dust and smoke in the beam, ground fog and mist, breath; rain and snow through open roofs and outside windows, rain on a pane, a puddle that reflects the film, a weather cycle (below, "Atmosphere and weather") | built |
| `life` | life | non-human ambient life: moths, birds, fish, fireflies, a cat, a deer, glowing deep-sea creatures, a whale, plane lights. Never people (below, "Ambient life") | built |
| `sound_bed`, `acoustics` | sound | looped beds and one-shots from our own synthesiser, placed in the room, on the Environment bus; the room's reverb (below, "Sound and music") | built |
| `music` | music | instruments that play themselves (a player piano, an organ), from our own synthesiser | built |
| timeline and cues | | below; part of the host, not a registered system | built |
| film signals | | below; part of the host | built |
| `presentation` | screen | the chain of stages from source to display: source (film, tape, broadcast), transmission (aerial noise, ghosting), display (CRT, mask, curvature, a telly's glass), the sound through a small speaker. TV-era presets | built |
| `seats` | seats | seat models outside the builders (folding chairs, plush tip-up seats, multiplex seats and a broken one, pews, club chairs, director's chairs, a bench seat, cushions, hides, a bean bag), drawn in the builders' seat slots, in rows of its own, or as broken seats over a builder's own | built |
| `motion` | motion | slow moves of the room's things (a curtain's sway, an organ rising, a painting sliding up, a festoon rising in swags, Earth turning), held to the comfort limits. Never the viewer | built |

## Bindings and film signals

A live parameter can follow a channel. The binding is data:

```json
"house_lamps": {"bind": "film.brightness", "range": [0.2, 1.0], "smooth": 0.5}
```

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| `bind` | the channel (below) |
| `range` | `[a, b]`: the channel's value (0..1) mapped onto a..b. Colours: `["#rrggbb", "#rrggbb"]` |
| `keys` | `[[x, y], ...]`: a piecewise-linear curve on the channel's raw value (film-time: `film.minutes`) |
| `map` | `{value: result}`: for a choice setting, `playback.state`, a bool (`"true"`, `"false"`) |
| `smooth` | seconds: the time constant of a low-pass on the result |
| `invert` | `true`: 1 - the value, before `range` |
| `strength` | for `film.colour` on a colour: how far the colour goes from `base` towards the film's (0..1) |
| `base` | the colour `strength` starts from |

One of `range`, `keys` and `map`, or none (the value as it is). A binding is checked against the parameter's type
and range: a binding whose range leaves the parameter's range is refused.

| Channel | What | Range |
|---|---|---|
| `film.colour` | the picture's dominant colour: the mean of the bias light's 4 x 2 copy of the video planes (`scripts/env/bias_light.gd`), read back without a stall | colour |
| `film.brightness` | the luminance of that colour | 0..1 |
| `film.bass` | the low end (20-120 Hz) between `film_react.gd`'s floor and full levels; available with `[react]` off (the analyser runs while a room asks for it) | 0..1 |
| `film.transient` | a sudden loud jump: 1 at the jump, falling to 0 over 0.5 s | 0..1 |
| `film.quiet` | low sound energy (under -38 dBFS) and little picture change, held for 3 s; falls at once when either ends | 0..1 |
| `film.progress` | position over duration. A source with no length (a live stream) goes by the time watched and never reaches 1: half way after an hour, three quarters after two (`env_signals.gd ENDLESS_HALF_MINUTES`; before 2026-11-09 it stayed at 0) | 0..1 |
| `film.minutes` | position in minutes | raw |
| `time.of_day` | daylight from the time of day (`scripts/env/time_of_day.gd`): 0 at -12 degrees of sun, 1 at +12 | 0..1 |
| `playback.state` | the timeline's state (`map` it) | a name |
| `playback.playing` | 1 while playing | 0..1 |
| `setting.<name>` | a room setting: a range normalised over its own range, a bool 0 or 1, a choice by `map` | 0..1 |
| `comfort.motion` | the room's Motion setting | 0..1 |
| `weather.rain`, `weather.snow` | what falls now (the weather system; 0 without one) | 0..1 |
| `weather.wet` | how wet the room is: it follows the rain and dries slowly after it | 0..1 |
| `journey.speed` | how fast the journey goes now against its own speed (the passing system; 0 without one) | 0..1 |
| `journey.progress` | how far along its route the journey is | 0..1 |

Tests feed the channels with `signals.fake(channel, value)`.

## Timeline and cues

### States

| State | When |
|---|---|
| `preshow` | nothing open, or a film open at its start and not started |
| `starting` | the first `starting_seconds` (default 8) after a film starts from its start |
| `playing` | playing |
| `paused` | paused after it started |
| `intermission` | `scripts/play/intermission.gd` is active |
| `credits` | the last `credits_minutes` (default 6, at most a tenth of the film) of a film over 20 minutes |
| `ended` | the film ended, until the next play or file |

The states come from playback: the player's `ended` signal, the intermission's `active`, the position and duration.
A jump of the position (a seek, a chapter, a file opened where it was left) is not a state: the timeline emits
`seeked(from, to)` and the host tells every system (`on_seek()`), since 2026-11-09. No cue fires for it. A binding
with `smooth` glides to its new value; a system that keeps a place along the film (the passing scenery) moves
there out of sight.
The pre-show's curtains (`preshow.gd`) close at the end as before; in a room whose cue opens them (`showing`), the
pre-show waits up to 4 s for the cue before it opens them itself.

### Cues

```json
{"name": "whale", "when": {"signal": "film.quiet", "above": 0.9, "for": 4},
 "states": ["playing"], "chance": 0.5, "cooldown": 900,
 "steps": [{"do": "whale.pass", "args": {"side": "left"}}]}
```

`whale.pass` is the action `pass` of the system with the id `whale` (a `life` system whose creature is the whale). The
whale sings as it passes, so the cue needs no `sound` step.

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| `name` | the cue's name |
| `when` | the trigger: `{"state": "starting"}` or a list of states (on entering one); `{"signal": "<channel>", "above" or "below": x, "for": seconds}` (once each time it crosses); `{"every": seconds}` |
| `requires` | `[{"setting": "<name>", "is": value}]`: settings that must hold (`is` left out: the setting is on). The common `ritual` setting is one |
| `states` | the states it may fire in |
| `chance` | 0..1, rolled each time it would fire |
| `cooldown` | seconds before it may fire again (the whale: at most once in 15 minutes) |
| `stop_in` | states that stop it while it runs: `["playing"]` stops a slow pre-show cue when the film starts. Its later steps don't run; what it set stays until a `release` or another cue |
| `steps` | run in order: `{"set": "<id>.<param>", "to": v, "seconds": s, "ease": "linear" or "in" or "out" or "in_out"}` (starts a fade and goes on), `{"wait": s}`, `{"release": "<id>.<param>", "seconds": s}` (back to its base value or binding), `{"do": "<id>.<action>", "args": {...}}`, `{"sound": "<synth>", "gain_db": g, "at": [x, y, z]}`, `{"stop": "<cue>"}` (stops another cue of the room while it runs) |

A cue's `set` holds the parameter until a `release`; a binding on the same parameter waits under it. A cue does not
start again while it runs.

### Film-time tracks

```json
"timeline": {"tracks": [{"target": "sky.dusk", "by": "film.minutes", "keys": [[0, 0.0], [10, 1.0]]},
                        {"target": "sky.stars", "by": "film.progress", "keys": [[0.05, 0.0], [0.3, 1.0]]}]}
```

A track is a binding on a live parameter by `film.minutes` or `film.progress`: dusk falling over the first 10 minutes,
the stars coming out.

### The ritual in the converted cinema

`ritual` (a cue of `cinema.env.json`): when the film starts from its start, a soft chime from the synthesiser plays
on the Environment bus near the stage, the house lamps come down to half over 1.5 s, the curtains part over 3.5 s,
and after 2 s the lamps go down to the room's "House lights in the film" setting (20 % by default) over 5 s. The
room light dims as before (light follows playback). In the pre-show and after the end (`lights_up`) the lamps come
back up over 4 s. With the common "Pre-show" setting off there are no curtains and `dim` takes the lamps down over
3 s instead. A change to the House lights setting during the film moves the lamps at once (a cue held at a setting's
value follows it).

## Room settings

Every room has settings: the common ones from the shared systems, and the room's own from its document.

### Common settings

| Name | Type | Default | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dim` | bool | true | dim during the film (the room light follows playback, `light_follow.gd`) |
| `ambience_db` | range -25..6 dB | 0 | the room's ambience against the global Environment slider; -25 is off (the room's mute) |
| `life` | bool | true | ambient life on or off (rooms with a `life` system) |
| `ritual` | bool | true | the pre-show: the curtains and the ritual cue (rooms with curtains or a cue that requires it) |
| `flicker` | bool | true | lights that flicker (an exit sign, a candle): off holds them steady |
| `motion` | range 0..1 | 1 | motion comfort: scales every `motion` parameter (gate weave, a tilt, a sway) |
| the seat | | the room's own | the chosen seat, as the Seat section keeps it (`[seats] <id>`); Back to defaults goes back to the room's own seat |

A common setting shows where it has an effect: `life` with a `life` system, `ritual` with curtains or a cue that
requires it, `flicker` with a parameter that flickers, `motion` with a `motion` parameter.

### A room's own settings

```json
"settings": [
  {"name": "weather", "type": "choice", "choices": ["rain", "mist", "clear", "changing"],
   "labels": ["Rain", "Mist", "Clear", "Changing"], "default": "changing",
   "label": "Weather", "description": "Rain on the roof, mist in the ferns, a clear night, or each in turn."}]
```

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| `name` | its id: lower-case letters, digits and _ |
| `type` | `bool`, `range` (`min`, `max`, `step`, `format`: `percent`, `db`, `seconds`, `minutes`, `times`, `number`), `choice` (`choices` and their `labels`) |
| `default` | within its range or choices |
| `label`, `description` | English; translation keys (`tools/i18n.py` reads them from `app/environments/*.env.json`) |

A setting reaches the systems through bindings: `{"bind": "setting.weather", "map": {"rain": 1.0, "clear": 0.0}}`, and
through cues' `requires`. Examples from the set:

| Room | Setting | Binding |
|---|---|---|
| Reclaimed | `weather`: rain, mist, clear, changing | `weather.mode` by `map` |
| Drive-in | `tinny`: the window speaker (bool) | `presentation.speaker` by `map` |
| Pillow Fort | `telly_fills`: the telly fills the fort's opening (bool) | `domestic.opening_screen` (not live: the fort builds again) |
| Screen 3 | `weave`: gate weave and tilt (range 0..1) | `presentation.weave` and `.tilt` by `range` |
| Bathysphere | `whale`: how often the whale comes (choice: never, rare, sometimes) | the whale cue's `chance` by `requires` per choice |
| Crater | `earth_speed`: Earth's turning speed (range 0.5..4 times) | `sky.earth_turn` by `range` |
| Cinema | `house_level`: house lights in the film (range 0..0.6) | the room light's dimmed level |
| Void | `ripple`: ripple strength (range 0..1) | `mirror_floor.ripple` by `range` |

### Storage, the menu and the assistant

- Stored as `[room:<id>] <name>` in `user://settings.cfg`, only a change from the default; back to the default
  erases the key, as elsewhere.
- The Room tab's "This room" section builds itself from the declarations: a toggle for a bool, a slider for a range,
  a row of choices for a choice, and the description under it. "Back to defaults" puts every setting of the room back.
- The assistant: `room_settings` (read) gives `this_room`: every declaration as a JSON Schema, its value and its
  default. `room_setting` (level room) sets one, or puts all back (`reset`). Both come from the same declarations.

## The next phase

Systems first, in parallel, then rooms. Each agent owns its files below, adds one line per system to `registry.gd`
(and the kind to `KINDS` if new), and its own `app/tests/test_env_<system>.gd`. Nobody else edits a file another
agent owns; the shared files take additive changes only (`registry.gd`, `env_doc.gd` constants such as `SOUNDS`,
`zh_CN.po` appended). Each system passes the checks through a small test room in its test, not a shipped room.

**Phase 1: systems** (seven agents at once)

| Agent | Systems | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| A sky and vista | `sky`, `vista` | `systems/sky.gd`, `systems/vista.gd`, `app/shaders/env_sky*.gdshader`, star catalogue data (public domain) |
| B atmosphere and weather | `atmosphere`, `weather` | `systems/atmosphere.gd`, `systems/weather.gd`, `app/shaders/env_haze*`, `env_rain*` |
| C ambient life | `life` | `systems/life.gd`, `systems/life/*.gd` (one creature each), `app/shaders/env_life*` |
| D sound and music | `sound_bed`, `acoustics`, `music` | `systems/sound_bed.gd`, `systems/acoustics.gd`, `systems/music.gd`; takes over `env_synth.gd` |
| E presentation | `presentation` | `systems/presentation.gd`, `app/shaders/env_presentation*`; TV-era presets |
| F builders | `shopfront`, `nave`, `dome_hall`, `terrace`, `domestic`, `vehicle`, `kit` | `systems/<name>.gd` each, `systems/kit/*` |
| G seats and motion | `seats`, `motion` | `systems/seats.gd`, `systems/motion.gd`, the seat model slot of `auditorium.gd` (`seat_model`, `seat_mesh()` only) |

The foundation's own files (`env_host.gd`, `env_timeline.gd`, `env_signals.gd`, `env_audio.gd`, `env_checks.gd`,
`room_settings.gd`, `env_room.gd`, `auditorium.gd` apart from G's slot) stay with one agent, if any change is
needed at all: a system that needs a new host hook asks for it rather than editing the host.

**Phase 2: rooms** (after phase 1 is merged; as many agents as rooms, two or three rooms each)

A room is its document alone: `app/environments/<id>.env.json`, with no scene. `scripts/env/env_library.gd`
lists every document without a `.tscn` beside it, so a room agent touches no list in `main.gd`,
`env_library.gd` or `room_tab.gd`; `tools/i18n.py extract` takes the room's name and settings' words from the
document. Each room agent owns its documents, its CC0 assets under `app/environments/<id>/`, its rows in
`app/environments/CREDITS.md` (one block per room, appended) and its Chinese entries appended to `zh_CN.po`.
`test_environments.gd` checks every document without change.

## Open questions

- **The command name.** `room_settings` already named the Room tab's state for the assistant; its result now has
  `this_room` (the declarations and values), and `room_setting` sets one. A separate `room_settings` with both was
  not possible without breaking existing clients.
- **`film.colour` on the headset.** The colour is read back from the bias light's 4 x 2 copy with the rendering
  device's asynchronous read (no stall). Its cost on the Frame is not measured yet; it runs only while a binding uses
  the colour or the brightness.
- **Credits for long films.** `credits` is the last six minutes (at most a tenth). Chapters named "Credits" would be
  better where the file has them.
- **The ducking curve** is the engine's compressor, keyed from Film: its settings are chosen from the test tone, not
  from listening in the headset.
- **The Void's reflection** is now on by default (it was off): the Void's design is a mirror floor. It costs a
  quad that samples the video.
- **Room sound levels by ear.** Every bed and instrument is measured on the desktop, not heard in the headset. The
  designed levels are 12 dB or more under the level check's target, so a room can lift one with `gain_db` after a
  listen.
- **A cue's long one-shot.** `env_audio.play` makes a sound it has not made before on the main thread (the train:
  about 1 s on a desktop). Rooms play long one-shots through a `sound_bed` (`every` or its `play` action), which makes
  them on a worker thread.
- **The shortest reverb.** The engine's reverb has no tail under about 0.5 s. `small_room`, `vehicle` and `outdoors`
  use its smallest room with a little wet; a shorter tail would need another effect.
- **A telly's shape** (settled 2026-11-07). The presentation still draws on the screen's own mesh at the film's
  aspect, but `tube` gives the CRT's corners and bulge the tube's shape round it.
- **The presentation in the layer.** A source-only chain (weave and grain) could stay in the film layer, as the
  projector feature's weave does; the presentation draws in the room for every picture stage, for one path. Its cost
  on the Frame is not measured yet.
- **Ambient life on the Frame.** The creatures' ticks are measured on the desktop only (under 1 ms for all nine). A
  room with many fliers should be timed on the headset.
- **Parts of a room in front of the picture (settled 2026-11-07).** The domestic painting (while down) and the
  pillow fort's hem are in the group `env_in_front`, as motion's in-front things are, so on the Frame the film
  layer steps aside while they cover the picture and the film draws in the room behind them. A fort hem over the
  picture keeps the film in the room for the whole showing (the layer's sharpness is lost there).
- **Auto parameters in `domestic`.** Its parameters left on auto take the style's values, so the licences check
  reads only the materials a document names. Every style's material is a bundled CC0 library material, so the check
  still holds, but it does not see them.
